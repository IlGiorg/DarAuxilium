# DarAuxilium
### An easy and customizable solution for support.

## About DarAuxilium

DarAuxilium is a very basic support solution that includes
a **Ticketing System**, **Support Articles** and a very comprehensive **Staff Panel**.

## Why DarAuxilium
Well, I built it because i needed a way to **organize, streamline** and **make easier** the way I help.
I managed to achieve this by preventing tickets in the first place with the [Articles](## Articles) feature.

DarAuxilium is super easy to install, just grab the latest release, shove it in an htdocs folder, setup the database and you're good to go! It usually takes less than 1 hour

Oh and also, I didn't want to spend anything, so I made myself and giving it to you for **free**.

## Tickets
Well, if you need to open a ticket is probably because you're too lazy to open up Google or you straight up don't know how to, which is why I tried to make DarAuxilium as idiot-proof as possible, with only three buttons on the MyAuxilium panel (fancy for "index.html")
## Articles
Don't want to answer tickets repeatedly for always the same stuff? Save A LOT of time by just writing an
article on how to solve often issues such as plugging the HDMI cable in the motherboard instead of the GPU. 

I'm also planning to make it so that if the description of an issue is similar to an article, you'll get redirected there.
